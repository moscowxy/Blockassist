# Blackjack Game Improvements & Changes

## Summary

I've created a complete, production-ready blackjack game frontend based on the CrispenGari/blackjack repository and your smart contract. The game is fully mobile-responsive and optimized for Farcaster miniapps.

- Wagmi setup for wallet connection
- Support for Base mainnet and Base Sepolia
- Contract ABI definitions
- Transaction handling with loading states
- Real-time state polling
- Game state synchronization
- Ready for VRF randomness integration

### 5. Features Added

#### Game Modes:
- **Demo Mode**: Play immediately without blockchain
- **Contract Mode**: Ready for on-chain play (with your BaseBlackjack.sol)

#### Statistics Panel:
