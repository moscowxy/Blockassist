   - `win.mp3` - Sound when player wins
   - `lose.mp3` - Sound when player loses
   - `blackjack.mp3` - Sound when player gets blackjack
   - `bust.mp3` - Sound when player goes over 21
   - `chip.mp3` - Sound for placing bet

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=your_sepolia_contract_address
```

### Game Rules

The game follows standard blackjack rules:

- **Goal**: Get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over
- **Card Values**: 
  - Ace = 1 or 11 (automatically chosen for best score)
  - Face cards (J, Q, K) = 10
  - Number cards = their face value
- **Actions**:
  - **Hit**: Draw another card
  - **Stand**: Keep current hand and let dealer play
- **Dealer**: Must hit until score is at least 17
- **Blackjack**: Ace + 10-value card = automatic win
- **Bust**: Going over 21 = automatic loss

## Game Logic Improvements

### Error Fixes

1. **Proper Ace Handling**: Aces are now correctly calculated as 1 or 11 based on current score
2. **Score Calculation**: Fixed edge cases in score computation
3. **Game State Management**: Proper state transitions between game phases
4. **Dealer Logic**: Dealer follows correct blackjack rules (hits until 17+)

### UI/UX Improvements

1. **Mobile Responsive**: Cards scale appropriately on small screens
2. **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons optimized for mobile taps
3. **Visual Feedback**: Smooth animations for card flips and game state changes
4. **Sound Toggle**: Users can enable/disable sound effects
5. **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes
